# know-your-emoji
Enter the emoji to get its meaning

I made this app on the codeSandbox platform. 
This app is made using the react framwork.

This is just like emojipedia. Here we have a small data base of emojis and we want to get the meaning of that emoji.
This website made it simple by just entering the emoji in the search bar and it will get the meaning for you.
If we don't have that emoji in our database then it will show the message of not having emoji in the database.

This is make just for fun and I learnt a lot about how to interact with loops and useState and dictionaries and lists.
